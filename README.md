##  Problem Statement

Most students are exhausted by having to switch between multiple websites for everyday needs—checking dining menus, searching for lost items, following club updates, and keeping track of events. The lack of a centralized student platform results in scattered communication and unnecessary inefficiency. IIITB HUB addresses this problem by bringing all essential student resources together into one unified, streamlined platform.
